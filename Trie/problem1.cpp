//Given an array of integers, we have to find two elements whose XOR is maximum
// Suppose we have a data structure which can satisfy two types of queries:
// 1. Insert a number X
// 2. Given a Y, find maximum XOR of Y with all numbers that have been inserted till now.
// If we have this data structure, we'll insert integers as we go, and with query of 2nd type we'll find the maximum XOR.

// Given an array of N numbers, we wish to choose a contiguous sub-sequence of the array, so that thebitwise XOR of all chosen numbers is maximum.
// Bitwise XOR is defined as follows: 
// every bit in theanswer is obtained by applying XOR logic on the corresponding bits of the set of numbers. 
// For example7, 8 and 5 are XORed as follows,
// Numbers  in  binary:    0111    1000    0101    -----    1010
// So the answer is 10 (in decimal). The same answer can be obtained in C/C++/Java by using theXOR operator as 7ˆ8ˆ5.
