### Graph
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes(vectices) and edges.

There are Two types of Graph:   
  **Directed Graph** : have pair of ordered vertices (u,v) != (v,u)  
  **Undirected Graph** : have pair of unordered vertices (u,v) == (v,u)  
  
  #### Graph Representation
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Adjacency Matrix**: A (V x V) Matrix where V is the number of vertices. If there is edge from vertex i to vertex j, then set A[i,j] = 1, else 0. If it is a weighted graph then set A[i,j] = weight/cost.  
  [Note: if all diagonals are zero, then there is no self loop.]  
  
     Advantages:   Easy to implement  
                   Removing an edge takes O(1) time  
                   Search for an edge between vertex 'u' to 'v' takes O(1) time  
                   
    Disadvantages: Consumes more space O(V^2)  
                   Adding a vertex is O(V^2)  
                 
                 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Adjacency List**: An array of linklist is used. Size of an array is equal to the number of vertices and each entry of array corresponds to a linked list of vertices adjacent to the this index.  
  
   Advantages: Saves space O(v+E), worst case O(v^2)  
               Adding a vertex is easier  
   Disadvantage: Queries take O(v)
